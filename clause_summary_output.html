This standard applies specifically to compliance with the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act and other relevant antitrust laws.

For the Target, the cap applies to business units that generated over $140 million in net sales during the 2024 fiscal year. Units below this threshold are exempt from remedy obligations, thereby limiting the Target's exposure to divestiture. Conversely, the Buyer, including the Parent and its Subsidiaries, is not obligated to undertake any remedy actions concerning businesses and products of the Company and its Subsidiaries that individually or collectively exceeded $140 million in net sales during the same fiscal year. This provision effectively shields the Buyer from remedy actions for larger revenue-generating units.</div><div class="ref-para"><span class="ref-bullet">○</span><span class="ref-text">References: Section 5.4 (d)</span></div><h3>Prior Approval Commitment</h3><div class="bullet-para"><span class="bullet">+</span>Prior Approval Commitment are not disclosed in the agreement.</div><h3>Transaction Interference</h3><div class="bullet-para"><span class="bullet">+</span>The Company and its Affiliates are prohibited from selling, divesting, holding separate, leasing, licensing, transferring, disposing of, or otherwise encumbering or impairing their assets, properties, businesses, or product lines.
